## 💡 About the Project

This app allows you to undergo an interactive interview with AI.
You can communicate with the AI using your voice, and it will ask you questions directly related to the chosen profession, staying on-topic throughout the conversation. The AI will guide the interview without straying from the relevant subject matter, providing a focused and meaningful experience.

The user can choose:
- **Communication Language**: 🇺🇦 Ukrainian, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇬🇧 English
- **Profession**: Frontend / Backend / Fullstack / DevOps / QA / PM / Designer / Data Scientist, etc.
- **Knowledge Category** within the chosen profession

> ⚠️ **Note!** The quality of voice synthesis (including Ukrainian, English and other languages) depends on the language settings of your device.
This is a demo project and the paid LLM APIs were not used to avoid unnecessary costs during testing.
