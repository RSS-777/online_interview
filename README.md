## 💡 About the Project

This app allows you to undergo an interview with AI interactively.  
The user can choose:

- **Language**: 🇺🇦 Ukrainian, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇬🇧 English
- **Profession**: Frontend / Backend / Fullstack / DevOps / QA / PM / Designer / Data Scientist, etc.
- **Knowledge Category** within the chosen profession

> ⚠️ **Note!** Due to the use of a free API, the quality of the Ukrainian voice synthesis may not be ideal.  
> The language selection is for communication with the artificial intelligence, and the voice output in Ukrainian might be of lower quality.  
> This is a demo project, and I didn't use paid LLM APIs to avoid spending on the demo version.
